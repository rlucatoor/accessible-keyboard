## How does it work

Some physically impaired people, such as those affected by [ALS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALS) or [PLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALS), are unable to use traditional keyboards due to impossibility to move their arms, fingers or other parts of the body. Accessible keyboards makes it possible for them to type by offering a keyboard on which keys light up consecutively, one at a time; when a key is lit, detection of a click is enough for the key to appear on the screen.
